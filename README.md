## 📖 About
This portfolio is designed to be a clean, modern, and interactive resume hosted on the web. It highlights my technical expertise, professional experience, and academic background using a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic and smooth scroll animations.

## ✨ Features
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Modern translucent visual effects for navigation and cards.
* **Scroll Reveal:** Elements fade in smoothly as you scroll down the page.
* **Interactive Mobile Menu:** Custom JavaScript toggle for smaller screens.
* **Dark Mode:** Built with a "Midnight" dark theme by default for a premium developer look.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
* **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling (via CDN) for rapid layout and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Logic for the mobile menu and scroll animations.
* **Google Fonts**: Typography using 'Inter' and 'Material Symbols'.
